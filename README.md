This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error involving type mismatches in function arguments. The file 'bug.ts' contains the erroneous code, and 'bugSolution.ts' provides a corrected version. The error occurs because the function 'add' expects two numbers, but the string "2" is passed as the second argument, causing a type error.
